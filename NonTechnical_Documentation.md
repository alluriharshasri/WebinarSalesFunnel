---

### 10.2 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

**"Service Unavailable" Error:**
- **Cause**: n8n service down or incorrect webhook URL
- **Solution**: Check `API_BASE_URL` in backend `.env`, verify n8n is running
- **Test**: `curl ${API_BASE_URL}/health`

**Registration Not Working:**
- **Cause**: Duplicate email or Google Sheets permission issue
- **Solution**: Check "User Data" sheet for duplicates, verify sheet sharing settings
- **Test**: Manually add row to sheet to test write access

**Login Fails (Wrong Password):**
- **Cause**: Password not matching bcrypt hash
- **Solution**: Reset password in Google Sheets (or implement forgot password feature)
- **Note**: Passwords in sheet are hashed, cannot be viewed directly

**Payment Not Updating:**
- **Cause**: n8n workflow error or sheet write failure
- **Solution**: Check n8n execution logs, verify sheet permissions
- **Workaround**: Manually update sheet row

**Dashboard Not Loading:**
- **Cause**: Google Sheets CSV export unavailable or CORS issue
- **Solution**: Check sheet sharing settings, enable CORS on Google Sheets API
- **Alternative**: Use direct Google Sheets API (not CSV export)

**AI Chatbot Not Responding:**
- **Cause**: n8n workflow down or AI API key invalid
- **Solution**: Check n8n "ai-chat" workflow, verify OpenAI/Claude API key
- **Fallback**: Displays error message, directs to contact form
